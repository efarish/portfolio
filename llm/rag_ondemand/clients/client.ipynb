       "\"Here’s a concise summary of the document:<br><br>1. Purpose  <br>   Researchers evaluated large language models (LLMs) in dynamic, simulated environments to see how well they plan, reason, and execute tasks.<br><br>2. Key Findings  <br>   • Model size helps: Larger models generally outperform smaller ones.  <br>   • Prompting matters: Strategic prompt engineering (e.g., chain-of-thought, tool use, re-prompting) narrows the gap between small and large models.  <br>   • Advanced methods boost performance but can be unstable or brittle.  <br>   • LLMs still struggle with planning, spatial coordination, and multi-step reasoning.  <br><br>3. Research Directions  <br>   • Beyond static benchmarks: Dynamic tasks better reveal reasoning and planning abilities.  <br>   • Grounded language learning: Aligning language with actions and perceptions in environments.  <br>   • Interactive decision making: Agents learn from feedback and adapt.  <br>   • Efficiency vs. capability: Balancing model size, compute cost, and task performance.  <br><br>4. Benchmarks & Domains Covered  <br>   • Robotics and spatial tasks (e.g., navigation in 3D worlds)  <br>   • Reinforcement learning environments  <br>   • Text-based planning and coding tasks  <br>   • Instruction following with human feedback  <br><br>5. Challenges Identified  <br>   • Scalability of reasoning methods  <br>   • Robustness of planning under uncertainty  <br>   • Measuring real-world generalization in simulated settings  <br><br>Overall, while LLMs show promise for grounded decision-making, significant work remains to improve their planning stability, reasoning depth, and real-world applicability.\""

       "\"The experiments were run in four prototypical testbeds, each designed to probe different aspects of sequential decision-making and generalization:<br><br>1. Bandit  <br>   – A classic N-armed bandit problem in which at each round the agent selects one of several “slot‐machine” arms.  <br>   – Each arm yields stochastic payoffs drawn from an unknown distribution.  <br>   – The agent’s goal is to maximize cumulative reward by balancing exploration (trying less-pulled arms) against exploitation (choosing the empirically best arm).<br><br>2. Rock Paper Scissors  <br>   – A two-player zero-sum game where the agent repeatedly chooses Rock, Paper, or Scissors.  <br>   – Payoffs are determined by the standard win/tie/lose payoff matrix.  <br>   – Serves as a simple adversarial setting to study equilibrium learning and adaptation to an opponent’s strategy.<br><br>3. Tower of Hanoi  <br>   – A puzzle environment with three pegs and a stack of disks of varying sizes.  <br>   – The agent moves one disk at a time, never placing a larger disk atop a smaller one, with the objective of transferring the entire stack from the start peg to a target peg.  <br>   – Tests the ability to plan multi‐step, constraint‐satisfying sequences of moves.<br><br>4. Messenger  <br>   – A simulated communication/interaction environment in which the agent must send, receive, or route messages to accomplish specified tasks.  <br>   – Though details vary by experiment, it generally examines how agents learn protocols and handle information exchange under uncertainty.\""
