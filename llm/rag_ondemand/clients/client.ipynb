       "\"We evaluated our methods across four very different simulated tasks, each designed to probe a distinct aspect of sequential decision‐making and language understanding:<br><br>1. Bandit  <br>   • A classic multi‐armed bandit setup in which the agent repeatedly chooses among a set of “slot machines” (arms) with unknown reward probabilities.  <br>   • The core challenge is to balance exploration (trying out less familiar arms) versus exploitation (pulling the arm believed to yield the highest payoff).<br><br>2. Rock Paper Scissors  <br>   • A repeated zero‐sum game against an adaptive opponent.  <br>   • Success requires (a) following high‐level strategic instructions, (b) learning the opponent’s play patterns over time, and (c) handling long contextual sequences of past moves to plan your next throw.<br><br>3. Tower of Hanoi  <br>   • A three‐rod, three‐disk puzzle where the goal is to transfer the entire stack from one rod to another.  <br>   • The agent must plan a sequence of moves under the hard constraint that no larger disk may ever sit atop a smaller one.  <br>   • This tests spatial reasoning, hierarchical planning, and constraint‐aware decision making.<br><br>4. Messenger  <br>   • A navigation‐and‐delivery task on a grid with obstacles and (sometimes) moving enemies.  <br>   • Instructions are given in natural language and often involve synonyms (e.g., “exit” vs. “way out,” “foe” vs. “enemy”).  <br>   • The agent must parse these linguistic cues, map them onto actionable moves, avoid hazards, and deliver the message to its goal location.<br><br>Together, these four environments span pure exploration‐exploitation, strategic game play, hierarchical spatial planning, and grounded language understanding.\""
