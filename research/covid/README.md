# Project: COVID-19 Feature Importance Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to determine the contributing factors of COVID-19 mortality during a time-period in the United States spanning January 2020 to June 2021. This analysis will also try to determine an order of importance for those factors. The purpose of this analysis is not produce an optimize predictive model. It is focused on understanding the contributed factors to COVID deaths. Performance metrics are only used to evaluate the quality of the models. As these will be regression models, `RMSE` will be used to evaluate the quality of each model.
