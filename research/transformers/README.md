# Project: Evolution of Transformers

This is a video presentation I gave while earning my masters degree in 2023. It reviews the evolution of the Deep Learning architectures that led to the Transformer architecture introduced in the paper [Attention Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762.pdf).
