#Project: Music Genre Classification

The dataset used to train the models consists of 100k MP3 audio files.

Our task is to build models that classify music by genre. 

Example genres: Electronic, Experimental, Folk, Hip-Hop, Instrumental, International, Pop, Rock

We'll review the models built, their performance, and discuss points of interest and lessons learned.

Models developed:
MLP
CNN
RNN
LSTM
