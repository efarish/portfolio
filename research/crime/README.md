# Project: NYC Crime Statistics for 2021

This project uses Tableau to visualize NYC crime statistics by location and demographics.

The data set used for this analysis came from the New York Police Departmentâ€™s (NYPD) [OpenData](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/) website and is called the "NYPD Complaint Data Current (Year To Date)". It includes all crimes reported to the NYPD for the year 2021.
The purpose of this visualization is to provide a dashboard to compare the relative personal safety of
New York City neighborhoods using data published by the New York City Police Department (NYPD)
for the year 2021.
