# Project: XGBRegressor and LightGBM

This project experiments with XGBoost and LightGBM and uses scikit-optimize for hyperparameter tuning.

The dataset used is the Abalone dataset and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s4e4/overview).

See the notebook [here](https://github.com/efarish/portfolio/blob/main/research/abalone/Boosting.ipynb) for details.
