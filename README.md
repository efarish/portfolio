# Portfolio

The purpose of this portfolio is to demonstrate my expertise in Python, machine learning, data analysis, and architectural design. Most of the projects were developed using a mixture of AWS SageMaker, Google Colab, and VS Code.    

The types of projects in this portfolio are:

- [LLM Projects](https://github.com/efarish/portfolio/tree/main/llm): Examples of using large language models. Each has a demo on the README page.
- [Research Projects](https://github.com/efarish/portfolio/tree/main/research): My application of Data Science techniques for research.
- [AWS Projects](https://github.com/efarish/portfolio/tree/main/aws): Projects that utilize various AWS services like CloudFormation, ECS, SageMaker, S3, Lambda, and API Gateway.
- [Fundamentals](https://github.com/efarish/portfolio/tree/main/fundamentals): Examples of using commmon ML algorithms for various tasks.
- [Mobile Application](https://github.com/efarish/portfolio/tree/main/mobile/kivy_img_post): A demonstration project showing how Python can be used to created mobile device applications that are integrated with cloud services like AWS.
