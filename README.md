# Portfolio

The purpose of these projects is to demonstrate my expertise in machine learning, NLP, and data analysis. Implemented using Python, the projects utilize the LLM models like OpenAI's GPT and Meta's Llama, along with frameworks such as Hugging Face, LangChain, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Numpy, and Tableau. Additionally, they demonstrated my experience in using different development platforms such as Google Colab and AWS SageMaker. 

The types of projects in this portfolio are:

- [LLM Projects](https://github.com/efarish/portfolio/tree/main/llm): Examples of using large language models. Each has a demo on the README page.
- [Research Projects](https://github.com/efarish/portfolio/tree/main/research): My application of Data Science techniques.
- [AWS Projects](https://github.com/efarish/portfolio/tree/main/aws): Examples of using AWS services like SageMaker, S3, Lambda, and API Gateway.
- [Fundamentals](https://github.com/efarish/portfolio/tree/main/fundamentals): Examples of using commmon ML algorithms for various tasks.
- [Mobile Application](https://github.com/efarish/portfolio/tree/main/mobile/kivy_img_post): A demonstration project showing how Python can be used to created mobile device applications that are integrated with cloud services like AWS.
